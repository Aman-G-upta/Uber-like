## Code of Conduct

Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/visheshrwl/Uber-like/blob/main/Code_Of_Conduct.md).

## Writing Commit Messages :memo:

Please [write a great commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line.
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
3. Capitalize the subject line.
4. Do not end the subject line with a period.
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (example: "Fix networking issue").
6. Wrap the body at about 72 characters.
7. Use the body to explain **why**, not what and how (the code shows that!).

**Example:**
```
[TAG] Short summary of changes in 50 chars or less

Add a more detailed explanation here, if necessary. Possibly give 
some background about the issue being fixed, etc. The body of the 
commit message can be several paragraphs. 

Resolves: #123
